This image is based on MSDOS 6.22 (any other is possible). Disk size 4 Mb.  <br>
For network exchange, the FTP Software PC/TCP network stack is used.        <br>
You can connect to the controller remotely via TCP/IP from any computer (and OS) with Java installed. <br>
Downloading programs to the controller during operation is carried out via FTP. <br>
Image preparation, as well as debugging of the program can be done through a virtual machine (I used VirtualBox 5 and QEMU/KVM). <br>
