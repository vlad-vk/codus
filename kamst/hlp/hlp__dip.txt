~001^015 SCREEN: ~004RANGES
~000
~000 On the screen, the values the ranges of the APCS channels are determined.
~000 Object Interface Devices have an input range from 0 to 20 mA.
~000 Used conversion devices can have an output range of 0..5.0..20.4..20 mA.
~000 For each channel, you need to recalculate the range of the display scale and
~000 the zero offset.
~000 For devices with an output range of 4..20 mA, the conversion will be as follows:
~000 Display Scale Range = (Instrument Scale) + (Instrument Scale/4)
~000 Display scale zero = - (device scale/4)
~000 For devices with an output range of 0..5 mA, the conversion will be as follows:
~000 Display Scale Range = (Instrument Scale) * 4
~000 Display scale zero = 0.
~000 The "Filter" field defines the maximum value by which the
~000 current value of the channel for one cycle of the controller program.
~000 In the "Average" field, determine the number of cycles for which averaging occurs
~000 current value of the measured parameter.
