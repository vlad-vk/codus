~000                                                                                  
~002 OID~000 - Object Interfacing Device.                                      
~000                                                                                  
~001 Interface Device~000 - DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) converts
~000 digital value from the controller to the output electrical signal
~000 or ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), converts electrical signal
~000 from sensors or secondary devices into digital representation.
~000                                                                                  
~006 Signals are of the following types:~000
~000                                                                                  
~002 DI~000 - input electrical signal (discrete input), which
~000      converted to the numeric value 0 or 1.
~000      The level of the electrical signal up to 1 Volt corresponds to "Digital 0",
~000      signal level from 3 to 30 volts corresponds to digital value 1.
~000                                                                                  
~002 DO~000 - (digital output) digital value 0 or 1 is converted to output
~000      electrical pulse signal. Correspondence of impulses as in DI signal.
~000                                                                                  
~002 AI~000 - input electrical analog signal (analog input).
~000      In a certain period, according to the characteristics of the OID module
~000      (for modules of the series I7000 = 10 times per second) the current value is
~000      sampled input electrical signal and convert it to digital 16-bit value
~000      (0xFFFF or 65535).
~000                                                                                  
~000      The type of input electrical signal is set when setting up the OID module
~000      and is the same for the entire module. It can be: millivolts (0-500mV),
~000      Volts (+-10V) or milliamps (0-20mA).
~000                                                                                  
~000                                                                                  
~002 AO~000 - (analogue output) digital value (limits as for AI signals),
~000      generated by the controller program is transmitted to the OID module,
~000      which, according to its type, generates an output an electrical signal
~000      that is sent to the actuator.
~000                                                                                  
~000 Transfer between the controller and the OID module is carried out using the 
~000 communication protocol RS-485. Several modules combined with each other and 
~000 with the controller make up the RS-485 network. In such a network, each module
~000 must have its own unique number from 0 to 0xFF (0..255), which is set during
~000 configuration module.
~000 When configuring each module, it determines the exchange rate with by the
~000 controller (usually, this speed is the same for all modules and the controller).
~000 In the current configuration it is 115200 bps.
~000 Controller program sends periodically (at least 30 times per second) requests
~000 to each OID module, for these requests the OID modules return a response
~000 to the controller (sent a request to OID1 - received a response from OID1, 
~000 sent a request on OID2 - received response from OID2, etc.). If the answer 
~000 was accepted without errors - the counter of correct answers increases. 
~000 If the answer was accepted with an error - the counter of erroneous responses
~000 is incremented. Erroneous answers by the program controllers are not accepted!
~000
