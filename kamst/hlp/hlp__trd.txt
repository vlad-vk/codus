~005 TREND~000 - graphic display of the controlled parameter in real time.
~000 The trend (graph) shows what value of the controlled parameter was at
~000 a certain time.
~000
~005 axis Y~000 - the value of the controlled parameter 
~000          (display scale on the right side of the trend).

~000 trend grid. Frequency of archive recording and trend display - once per second.
~000 Under the time scale (from left to right) there is a time window of the current 
~000 position of the temporary cutoff and date window for this trend.
~000 Next are the boxes for the current values controlled parameters on a time slice.
~000 
~000 A time slice is a segment located perpendicular to the time scale and parallel
~000 to the time scale monitored value. It defines the time and value for the selected
~000 graph point. Moving the time slice to the desired point on the graph is carried out 
~000 by pressing the keys ~002Ctrl-arrow left(right)~000.

~000       graph is done from the keyboard). In this mode, you can view
~000       archives for any day and hour (if the archive was recorded).

~002 Ctrl-PgUp~000 - scroll the chart forward
~002 Ctrl-D~000    - set the date for viewing the archive. In the time slice date window 
~000             appears cursor.

~000 Use the numeric keys to enter the desired date and press the ENTER key.
~000 If the archive file for the entered date is found, then it will be displayed for viewing

~002 Ctrl-T~000 - set the time for viewing the archive. Time entry is done in the same way
~000          date entry. 
~000 After entering the time, the program searches for data for this time.
~000 After the search, the data for the specified or nearest found time will be displayed
~000 on the graph with the starting point in the lower right corner.

~000 When changing to another screen, the graph mode is set to TREND on the current date.
